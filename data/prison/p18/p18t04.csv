For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Counts are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
