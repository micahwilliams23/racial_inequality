Some States included an adjustment residual in their admission or release figure in order to balance the yearend 1977 count with the yearend 1978 count."
"2/ [1979] Generally, State inmates housed in local jails because of overcrowding are considered to be under State jurisdiction, and only exceptions to this rule are noted.
