"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Estimates were provided by state and federal departments of corrections’ administrative record systems and may not reflect prisoners’ self-identification of race or ethnicity. State, federal, and national totals by race or ethnicity differ from other tables in this report due to adjustments that BJS made in other tables to correct for differences between administrative records and prisoner self-reported data on race or ethnicity. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).",,,,,,,,,,,,
~Not applicable. State does not track this race or ethnicity.,,,,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Excludes persons of Hispanic origin (e.g., “white” refers to non-Hispanic whites and “black” refers to non-Hispanic blacks). See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"b/The BOP does not separate persons of Hispanic origin from the individual race categories when reporting to the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS). To do so, BJS used data from the 2018 Federal Justice Statistics Program (preliminary).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"c/Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific Islanders were combined into a single category and reported as Asian.",,,,,,,,,,,,
d/Persons of Hispanic origin may be undercounted due to ongoing changes in information systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,
e/State did not submit 2018 NPS data on race or ethnicity. Counts were imputed. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,
