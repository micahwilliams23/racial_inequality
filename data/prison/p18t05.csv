"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction with a sentence of more than one year per 100,000 U.S. residents, or per 100,000 U.S. residents in a given category. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1, 2019. Rates are for December 31 of each year and are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
