"Note: Use caution when interpreting these statistics. Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on the prisoner’s self-report upon admission to prison. Some jurisdictions use a prisoner’s reported country of birth to determine current citizenship. BJS changed the way it measured citizenship for the 2016 reference year, requesting that National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) respondents include all non-U.S. citizens held in the physical custody of state and federal correctional authorities and in private prisons, excluding prisoners held in local jails, with the exception of states with an integrated prison and jail system, and in the custody of other jurisdictions. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Data collected after 2016 should not be compared to data for previous years. See Methodology. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,
:Not calculated. Counts and percentages for 2017 and 2018 are not comparable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Unless otherwise noted, citizenship status is based on self-report by prisoners at the time of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,
b/Includes unsentenced prisoners and those of all sentence lengths.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c/U.S. and state totals for non-U.S. citizens by sex exclude California, New Hampshire, and Oregon, which did not report citizenship counts by sex.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"d/Prison population count is the sum of persons held in the custody of state and federally operated prisons and each jurisdiction’s private prison facilities. In 2018, the total custody population in publicly and privately operated state and federal correctional facilities was 1,357,723 (1,178,510 state and 179,213 federal), and the sentenced custody population in those same facilities was 1,317,444 (1,151,578 state and 165,866 federal). These counts exclude custody populations for Rhode Island, which did not provide counts of non-U.S. citizens and whose numbers could not be imputed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"e/Total U.S. and state counts of non-U.S. citizen prisoners for 2018 include estimated counts for three states (California, New Hampshire and Oregon) that did not report statistics on non-U.S. citizens. The 92.3% of prisoners who are not counted as non-U.S. citizens may not be U.S. citizens, as some may have an unknown citizenship status.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"f/Citizenship data were subject to verification by an external data source (e.g., comparison to official records from U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or other relevant government agencies).",,,,,,,,,,,,
g/Prisons and jails form one integrated system. Data include total jail and prison populations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h/California did not submit accurate, verifiable figures on citizenship status. Citizenship data for the state are included in U.S. and state totals. They were estimated based on published counts from a state report (https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2019/08/DataPoints_122017.pdf) and represented the country of birth as reported by prisoners.",,,,,,,,,,,,
i/Estimate based on the number of offenders with ICE detainers.,,,,,,,,,,,,
j/State did not provide 2018 NPS data. Counts of non-U.S. citizens were imputed based on data for previous years. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,
k/Counts of non-U.S. citizens exclude those held in privately operated halfway houses.,,,,,,,,,,,,
l/Non-U.S. citizen count includes persons of unknown place of birth.,,,,,,,,,,,,
