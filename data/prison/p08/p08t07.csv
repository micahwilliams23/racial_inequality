"Note: Data are for inmates sentenced to more than 1 year under the jurisdiction of state correctional authorities. The estimates for gender were based on jurisdiction counts at yearend (NPS 1B). The estimates by race and Hispanic origin were based on data from 2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities and updated by yearend jurisdiction counts; estimates within offense categories were based on offense distributions from the National Corrections Reporting Program, 2006, updated by yearend jurisdiction counts. All estimates were rounded to the nearest 100. Detail may not add to total due to rounding.",,,,,,,
