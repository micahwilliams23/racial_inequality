"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. Rates and counts are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year under the jurisdiction of state or federal correctional officials. Imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction with a sentence of more than one year per 100,000 U.S. residents, or per 100,000 U.S. residents in a given category. Resident population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau for January 1, 2019. Totals include imputed counts for New Hampshire and Oregon, which did not submit 2018 National Prisoner Statistics data. See Methodology. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
